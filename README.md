This is a Grocery List application that was created as part of my React Hooks blog series! In this tutorial I demonstrated the proper use of useState. Together we created a simple grocery list application that allows users to search for grocery items (by connecting to an API), add items to their list and determine the quantity of that item. A counter is also present that counts the total amount of items in the list.
